              <h3> Chelsea FC </h3>
              <p>Chelsea FC are a European soccer team who compete in the Premier League in England. The Premier League is the most competitive league in Europe and in the past twenty years Chelsea have been title contenders. This year they are aiming for another league title after coming off of a Champions League winning season and after signing a few big name players like Romelu Lukaku. They have been consistently one of the best teams in Europe for some time now, and although they don’t have the history that some other clubs have, they are still a European powerhouse in soccer.</p>

              <h3>Dallas Cowboys </h3>
              <p> The Dallas Cowboys, also known as “America’s Team”, have been a dominant team in the NFL since before I was born. They have a total of five Super Bowl wins under their belt with their last one being in 1996. Although this was quite some time ago, the Cowboys are one of the best NFL teams historically and also the most valuable sports franchise on the planet. The 2000s have been a little rough for the Boys but with star quarterback Dak Prescott and running back Ezekiel Elliot, they have a bright future and potential to become Super Bowl winners once again.</p>

              <h3>Dallas Mavericks </h3>
              <p> The Dallas Mavericks were only founded in 1980 in the NBA, so they are still a relatively new team, but for this reason they are almost more impressive. Their last championship win was in 2011 against Lebron and the Heat and was surely an amazing feat considering the strength of the 2011 Heat roster. The Mavericks now have Luca Doncic, a bright young star in the NBA (and arguably one of the best players in the league), who has been putting up very impressive performances for the past few seasons. They are a very exciting team to watch and have been making playoff runs for the past few years. Currently they are one of the top teams in the NBA and their future is looking like it will only get better.
